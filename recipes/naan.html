        <h1>Naan (Afghan Style)</h1>
        <img src="../recipes/afghan-bread.jpg" alt="A picture of naan" width="600" height="600"> 
        <p>This bread is perfect for dipping into soups and stews, as well as serving with kebab. I've also used it in place of pita to make falafel wraps.</p>
        <br> 
        <p>It is a fool-proof recipe that has never failed me, and I really hope you do try it with the ash-e anar on this website!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 3/4 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp (one whole packet) dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (This is for the yeast, you should be able to put your finger in it without it burning)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp sunflower or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>semolina flour for dusting baking sheets</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>combine warm water and yeast, mix, and make sure it froths after a few minutes</li>
            <li>combine flour and salt, mix. add everything else except yeast mixture</li>
            <li>Add yeast mixture, bring to a mixer, connect bread hook and mix until everything is combined. If you need more water, go ahead and add it as it's mixing.</li>
            <li>once everything is combined, remove from mixer and knead by hand for about five minutes, until dough is soft, pliable, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>cover and let rise for an hour. Dough should get really really fluffy</li>
            <li>preheat oven to 400 F. coat two baking sheets with semolina flour</li>
            <li>Remove bread from bowl, cut in half, roll gently into two balls</li>
            <li>gently roll naan out to fit your baking sheet. it should be fairly thin, but not anywhere near paper thin. You want it to be soft, not crackly, when it comes out of the oven.</li>
            <li>bake in the oven for fifteen minutes. the naan will rise up in the oven and form a giant pocket in the center. it will not be crunchy. it will have slight brown blisters on it in some places.</li>
            <li>remove from oven and cut into halves or quarters, let rest on plate and then put away or eat</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As they say in Farsi, <i>nooshe jaan!</i> May it nourish your soul!</p>
        <h2>Variations:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brush naan with olive oil and garlic powder, or cilantro before going into the oven</li>
            <li>Mix olive oil and za'atar, and then brush it over the naan before going in the oven</li>
        </ul>
