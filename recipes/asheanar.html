        <p>This dish is an <i>ash</i>, or a type of soup made mainly in Iran and Afghanistan. <i>Anar</i> in Persian means pomegranate.
        So, alongside a variety of fresh herbs such as cilantro, flat leaf parsley, and mint, pomegranate molasses is added to the 
        broth for a distinctive sour taste.</p>
        <br> 
        <p>I make this soup with beef kofte, but you can also use ground chicken, lamb, or pork.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Pomegranate molasses can be difficult to find. I make my own by gently simmering fresh pomegranate juice into a syrup.
            Don't let the juice boil heavily, as it will ruin the fresh, sour flavor that you're trying to preserve.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Also- this soup must simmer with the lid off!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Soup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>11 cups water (add ten at the start, add the last cup an hour into cooking)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup split peas (washed, soaked)</li>
            
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch flat leaf parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Several full sprigs of mint, chopped (no stems)</li>
            <li>One bunch of green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, sliced into half moons</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sunflower oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 heaping tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 heaping tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2-4 tbsp pomegranate molasses</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Meatballs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb ground meat</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>A few dashes black pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup rice (washed, soaked)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the onion into half moons, add the oil, turmeric, cinnamon, and onion to a giant stock pot and saute on medium high heat until caramelized and soft. </li>
            <li>Add ten cups of water, the salt, and the split peas. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 Â½ hours.</li>
            <li>Add all the herbs and the green onions, as well as another cup of water. Simmer on low for 30 min - an hour. Adjust heat as needed, don&#39t lose all your broth. </li>
            <li>Add a coarsely chopped yellow onion to a food processor. Blend into a paste.</li>
            <li>Add the meat to the food processor. Blend until the meat is completely smooth, and the fat is activated (white threads in the meat). The food processor is imperative for making the meatballs super tender. </li>
            <li>Take the meat-onion mixture out of the food processor, add the salt, pepper, and rice. Mash together with your hands until everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>After the soup has simmered with the herbs, make little meatballs with your hands (like two tbsp of filling) and drop them into the soup. Crank the heat up to high and bring to a boil for a few minutes. Shake the pot to make sure the meatballs aren&#39t sticking together.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes reduce heat to simmer. Add the pomegranate molasses. Cook for at least thirty minutes, and then until meat is cooked through (Internal temp 180)</li>
            <li>Spoon the stew out into bowls. Make sure you get the ladle down to the bottom of the pot because all the split peas and rice are under the meatballs. Mash everything up in your bowl and serve with naan or barbari bread! </li>
            <li>I&#39ve never tried this, but I know a lot of people serve it with crispy fried onions and mint oil on top</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As they say in Farsi, <i>nooshe jaan!</i> May it nourish your soul!</p>
